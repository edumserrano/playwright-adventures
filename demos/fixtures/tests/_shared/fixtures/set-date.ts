  // We went with the simpler solution because the only thing we need to control is the year but if needed,
  // that GitHub issue shows other ways to control the flow of time. See https://github.com/microsoft/playwright/issues/6347#issuecomment-965887758
  // and other alternatives proposed in that issue.
  //
  // An alternative implementation could be similar to what was done to control institution test data where we created different providers on angular
  // and used a provider factory to choose which implementation to use. If in app mode use the app implementation and if in test mode use the test implementation.
  // We could do the same to control the date with a bit of refactoring on the app code. See:
  // - tests\_tests-shared\fixtures\load-institution-data.ts
  // - src\app\core\domain\institutions-data.service.ts
