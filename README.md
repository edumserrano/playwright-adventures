## Description

This repo aims to consolidate and share some of the experiences I've had and the solutions I've come up with whilst using Playwright to test Angular apps. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> Although the code demos presented here use Angular, the Playwright concepts that are demoed are frontend framework agnostic which means they and can be applied to any frontend framework.

## Required & recommended dependencies

If you face issues running any of the demos then check if you're missing one of the dependencies listed below.

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v20.10.0). Tested working with `v20.10.0`. If you need to have different versions of node installed it's recommended that you use [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install and swap between node versions.
- [npm@latest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm): package manager used on the demos. Tested working on `10.2.5`.
- [Git LFS](https://git-lfs.com/). The demos use Playwright to take screenshots and those images are uploaded to the repo using Git LFS. Without Git LFS you won't get any images when cloning the repo and the Playwright tests will fail. Tested working with `3.3.0`.
- [latest Powershell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/scripting/install/installing-powershell): some demos make use of powershell scripts. Tested working on `7.4.0`.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/): required for the demo that runs Playwright tests via docker.
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) is recommended as a code editor but you can use whatever you prefer.
