## Description

This repo aims to consolidate and share some of the experiences I've been faced with and the solutions I've come up with whilst using Playwright to test Angular apps. 

> [!NOTE]
>
> Although the code demos presented here use Angular, the Playwright concepts that are demoed are frontend framework agnostic which means they and can be applied to any frontend framework.
